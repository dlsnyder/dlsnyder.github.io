<b>Hey I am David Snyder</b></li>

GitHub is a really **amazing** website. 
I never had an idea how to make a website other than it was a lot of weird work.  
From the previous days in my MIS class i got to make a sample website.  
At first I didn't think this would be fun, but when I see it completed it looks *cool*.



Key's to what I learned:
* what github is
* how to set up an account
* how to make various websites
* how to change the text in it
* how to change the background color
* how to add a youtube video to it
